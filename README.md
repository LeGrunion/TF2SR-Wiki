This wiki runs on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to work.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install NodeJS (ideally v18.16 but v16 or above should work too i think)
3. Install all the necessary packages by running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in your local repo
4. Then run `npm run docusaurus start` to run the site locally (it automatically updates whenever you save your changes)
5. Make your epic and awesome and swag changes or additions
6. Make an epic and awesome and swag pull request
