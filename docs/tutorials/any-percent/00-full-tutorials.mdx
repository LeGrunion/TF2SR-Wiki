# Full game Tutorials

This wiki is built to be very modular, meaning the tutorials here will be broken down into a lot of short videos for individual strats and variations. This makes it easy for us to update the wiki whenever something new gets found in the run so we don't have to make a completely new tutorial series every year.

If that's not your cup of tea though, we do have full game tutorial series made by 3 different runners that go through the game level by level, rather than segment by segment. These won't be the most up-to-date, **but they are still a great place to start!**

:::diffe For Beginners

Bryonato's tutorial series is the OG, and it's very well suited for beginners since it goes into a ton of detail about the specifics of every segment and basic movement connecting strats.

:::diffm For Intermediates

<YouTube youTubeId="wXe9fClEwiQ"/>
Sway's series is more aimed at intermediate players who already have some experience in running the game. It's much shorter than Bry's series and it doesn't hold your hand as much, which makes it a good point to start if you already have some experience with the Source engine and the movement mechanics of Titanfall.

:::diffh For epic gamers

<YouTube youTubeId="izxZJYhi23k"/>
Blaidan's series is the most up-to-date of the three while taking a similar teaching approach as Sway. It gets you through the game quickly and covers the most recent (and also sometimes hardest) strats we have in the run.
