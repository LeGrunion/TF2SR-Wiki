### Titanless

There are many variations to this strat. Some are based on *Decepcaverns* and some on *Slingshot*. So learn one of those first and then base you Titanless route on them. 

:::

## Ash



The Ash boss fight can be skipped. There are 2 main variations of Ash skip that are used in runs: Hover Ash skip, and e-smoke ash skip.

Hover ash skip involves using the hover ability with the brute loadout to get to an unintended area and clip out of bounds, and then going around the ash fight to the end of the level.

E-smoke involves using the electric smoke ability with the expedition loadout to clip BT into the door to exit the fight, and then embarking BT to fully clip through the door and running to the end of the level. 

:::caution

 Hover ash skip can only be done if you have access to the brute titan loadout, so you can only do it if you don't do Abyss Chapter 1 out of bounds, or if you're doing an il (individual level).

E-smoke Ash is actually slower than hover Ash by about 5 seconds, but it's the only way to do Ash skip if you do Abyss 1 out of bounds, so do keep in maind that if you're doing Abyss 1 oob, you have to save more time than e-smoke ash loses for it to be worth it.

[this needs a different title structure because you don't need the ending section strat if you do hover ash skip. this is implied, however, by the current structure -mats]
