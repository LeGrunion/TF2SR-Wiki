Make sure to select Northstar [or Brute? -mats] before doing *Disembark Door Skip*. Otherwise some abilities might be on cooldown at the start of *Slone Fight*.

## Grunt Hallways

## MRVN Hallways

## Slone

There are **three important factors** to consider for Slone. Of course, killing Slone is important but you also need to set up *Andyshot* for the Blisk Cutscene after. Another important aspect is Precharge which will be explained shortly. 

### Slone Fight

:::diffm

### Fzzy Slone

[video]

Unfortunately there are no easier strats than Fzzy Slone here. But a poorly executed Fzzy Slone is still faster than having no strat at all! -mats

### Blisk Cutscene

### Andyshot

[Video]

With a time save of ~ seconds and an easy execution this strat is great for beginners. It's one of the first strats every new runner should learn. -mats

Make sure to select the bottom dialogue option when talking to BT for the last time.
