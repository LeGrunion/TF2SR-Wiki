### Early Disembark

### Instant Disembark
**AKA:** Vizembark, Decembark
<YouTube youTubeId="ycgXzdBuP1o" />

#### Note!

When doing Instant Disembark, you will have to fight Kane with Expedition due to skipping the Tone Loadout. Expedition is about 5 seconds slower than Tone, so you'll want to be at least that much faster to save time with this route.

## Kane fight

:::note

If you picked up Tone, it is optimal to use it in the fight. 

However, if you performed *Instant Disembark*, you need to fight Kane with Expedition because you didn't pick up Tone. Expedition is about five seconds slower than Tone.
