# ðŸ”¥ Trial by Fire

## Intro Fight

In the Intro section of Trial by Fire you need to escort Sarah to an elevator. To do this you need to clear out a bunch of titans. 
There are several strats for the Intro Fight but Encore has proven to be the most consistent. 
It uses Robcore to get core early and infinite flight core to melt through all enemies.
