# ☁️ Beacon 1

Beacon 1 is a short level and is, for the most part, an **autoscroller**.

:::caution Note

If you performed the Titanless route for Abyss 1 (Sandwich) earlier, its important to quickly exit to menu here and reload back into the level (this can also be done at the start of Beacon 1 instead)
This is necessary to get Scorch and Brute which were missed because of the previous route in Abyss 1.

## Start

As soon as you jump off of BT's back, wallrun onto the rocky wall on your left to jump ahead of BT. Jump off and optionally grab the next rock to get more height to make the small cliff without mantling (although this can also be done with some well-timed double jumps). Jump onto one of the rocks on the left side of BT's intended path - on the large rock in the center of the canyon, there is a small rock on the right edge that landing on gives you a good path to jump over the rock formation on the right, just before the damaging smoke area. Slidehop over to the beacon station where the stalkers are attacking.

## Stalker Fight

### Firestar and Hemlok

Use the firestars on the 4 rightmost stalkers, then use the hemlok to attack the weak points of the rest of the stalkers. On the left side of the middle section, three stalkers are clumped together; because of the damaging area of effect on the exploding stalkers, the left one here can be killed if you set the other 2 stalkers to explode. 

:::tip Note

Due to randomness based on hardware, some people have less stalkers compared to others; a similar strategy applies, except you may want to use the firestars on different stalkers.

### Frags and Spitfire

If you didnt do the titanless route for Abyss 1, or reloaded the level in EnC1 instead, you will have frag grenades and a spitfire. As you near the beacon station, cook a frag grenade so that when you throw it, it damages the stalkers nearest you. Finish them off with the spitfire and kill the rest of the stalkers by shooting their weak spots on their backs.

## Return to BT

Start a slidehop chain and wallkick off of the left-side wall for extra speed. Grab the top of the rock protruding above the E-Smoke for a better line towards BT. 

## Avoiding a Crash

Pay attention to his dialogue here, because entering too early could cause a crash; It is safe to enter if by the time the embark animation is over, BT says "Caution" or what sounds like "Chu-Yi" in mandarin. You are safe to enter if you see "This victory has raised our combat efficiency rating" in the subtitles. Otherwise, wait a few seconds to allow his dialogue to advance before embarking.

## Wrapping up

Swap to ronin as soon as you enter BT, and phase dash once you make it past the 2 electrical poles coming out of the ground. Hold crouch when in the air to keep your speed for as long as possible. Once you enter the beacon station, reach the far wall, then turn around and go into the left back corner, then dash and disembark (im not sure if this is exactly how it's done but its what i see in the current wr). This will make BT clip through the floor, then teleporting above to talk to the grunts and skipping some dialogue.

## Pre-speed

To hit the end-level trigger as quickly as possible, line yourself up with the furthest end of the wall where the far pipe connects. Right when the mission objective notifcation appears, start wallrunning and cFEB, then slide hop over to the door; it should open right before you "hit" it.
